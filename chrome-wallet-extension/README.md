### Components

1. **Chrome Extension** (`popup.html`, `popup.js`, `styles.css`)
   - User interface and wallet interactions
   - Local storage for caching data
   - Communication with bridge server

2. **Bridge Server** (`bridge-server.js`)
   - Express.js server running on localhost:3001
   - Translates HTTP requests to CLI commands
   - Handles CORS for Chrome extension

3. **CLI Integration**
   - Your existing Midnight CLI
   - Executes actual blockchain operations
   - Manages wallet and contract state

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/status` - Health check
- `GET /api/wallet` - Get wallet information
- `GET /api/balance` - Check current balance
- `POST /api/faucet` - Request testnet tokens
- `POST /api/contract/deploy` - Deploy contract
- `GET /api/contract/counter` - Get counter value  
- `POST /api/contract/increment` - Increment counter

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
# Start bridge server with auto-reload
npm run dev
```

### Simulation Mode

If the CLI is not available, the extension runs in simulation mode:
- Generates random balance updates
- Simulates contract interactions
- Useful for UI development and testing

### Customization

**Adding New Contract Functions**
1. Add new API endpoint in `bridge-server.js`
2. Add corresponding CLI command execution
3. Update extension UI in `popup.html` and `popup.js`

**Styling**
- Modify `styles.css` for UI customization
- Uses CSS custom properties for theming
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
